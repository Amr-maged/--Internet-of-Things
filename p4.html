<h2>Service-oriented architecture</h2>
A critical requirement of an IoT is that the things in the network must be inter-connected. IoT system architecture must guarantee the operations of IoT, which bridges the gap between the physical and the virtual worlds. Design of IoT architecture involves many factors such as networking, communication, business models and processes, and security (Ulmer et al. 2013; van Looy et al. 2014). In designing the architecture of IoT, the extensibility, scalability, and interoperability among heterogeneous devices and their business models should be taken into consideration. Due to the fact that things may move geographically and need to interact with others in real-time mode, IoT architecture should be adaptive to make devices interact with other things dynamically and support unambiguous communication of events. In addition, IoT should possess the decentralized and heterogeneous nature.

In IoT, service-oriented architecture (SoA) might be imperative for the service providers and users (Ciganek et al. 2014; Hachani et al. 2013). SoA ensures the interoperability among the heterogeneous devices in multiple ways (Panetto and Cecil 2013; Jardim-Goncalves et al. 2013; Wang and Xu 2012). Figure 3 provides a generic SoA, which consists of four layers with distinguished functionalities as below:
